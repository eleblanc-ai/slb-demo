Making Plans (excerpt from John F. Kennedy)
By Megan M. Gunderson, Abdo Publishing

John F. Kennedy became President of the United States on January 20, 1961. He had many plans when he took office. These included programs for higher wages and aid for people experiencing poverty. He also hoped to improve civil rights.
During this time, America was part of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Another plan was to put a person on the moon before the Communist Soviet Union did. As a result, Kennedy greatly improved the US space program.
Relationships with other countries were another concern for Kennedy. American officials wanted to stop the spread of Communism. So, they trained a group of Cubans to overthrow Cuba’s Communist leader. In 1961, the group invaded Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. However, the effort failed.
Then, in 1962, Communist China invaded India. Kennedy sent weapons to India’s army. Meanwhile, South Vietnam was fighting Communist North Vietnam. Kennedy sent thousands of US military advisers to help the South Vietnamese.
In October 1962, Kennedy learned nuclear missile bases were being built in Cuba. He wanted to stop Soviet ships from bringing supplies there. So, Kennedy stated that the US Navy would block Cuba’s coast.
The Soviet leader said his country would guard its shipping rights. A nuclear war could begin. But Kennedy held his ground. The Soviet ships stayed away from the blocked area. Kennedy won the showdown! This event became known as the Cuban Missile Crisis.
